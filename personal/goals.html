            <!-- Why These Goals -->
            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>Why This Matters to Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, I've always been fascinated by aviation. How aircraft work, the systems behind flight operations, 
                    the tech that keeps everything running. I'm not super knowledgeable yet, but I'm learning and working toward it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What gets me excited is the <strong>computational side</strong>. Using computers, data, and software to 
                    optimize flight operations, analyze performance, design systems. I want to work in offices and control centers, 
                    not with wrenches and wiring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now I'm building skills in the digital world (communities, content, connections). The plan is to use 
                    that as a foundation, then transition into aerospace while keeping the tech-focused approach.
