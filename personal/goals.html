                <h2>Why This Matters to Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I've always been fascinated by things that fly. From watching planes take off as a kid to learning 
                    about rocket launches and Mars missions, aerospace represents the perfect blend of engineering, 
                    innovation, and pushing human limits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I also love the digital world—building communities, creating content, and connecting with people. 
                    My goal is to merge both passions: use my digital skills now to build a foundation, then transition 
                    into aerospace while keeping that creative, community-focused mindset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not just chasing a career; I'm chasing a legacy. I want to be part of the generation that 
                    makes space travel accessible, designs revolutionary aircraft, and inspires millions along the way.
