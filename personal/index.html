                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a student with big dreams and even bigger ambitions. Online, I go by <strong>Ms03</strong>, 
                    and I'm passionate about aviation, building communities, learning constantly, and football (the beautiful game).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'll find me on Discord managing communities, creating content, and working towards 
                    a future in aerospace engineering. I believe in working hard, staying curious, and 
                    never settling for average. Oh, and if you ever call it "soccer" around me, we're going to have problems. ⚽

                <p>
                    ✈️ <strong>Aviation:</strong> Obsessed with aircraft, flight operations, and everything about how planes work (though I'm still learning the technical side)<br><br>
                    
                    ⚽ <strong>Football:</strong> My true love. Massive fan of the beautiful game, and let's just say I have a soft spot for a certain Catalan club that plays in blaugrana<br><br>
                    
                    🌐 <strong>Community Building:</strong> Managing communities and helping brands grow their online presence<br><br>
                    
                    🎨 <strong>Design:</strong> Not a pro, but I can work with design tools pretty well for side projects and client work<br><br>
                    
                    📚 <strong>Learning:</strong> Always picking up new skills and knowledge. Currently focused on school and building my foundation for aerospace engineering<br><br>
                    
                    🎮 <strong>Gaming (Casual):</strong> I play games here and there, but it's not really my main thing. More of a time filler than a hobby
